### About This Project - 4th Feb 2025

This is a hobby project I started on 2nd February 2025, aiming to build it within two weeks in my leisure time.

I heard Elon Musk’s call for the best code from hardcore software engineers, and it made me wonder:
What does "hardcore" really mean?

For me, "hardcore" means high stakes, no second chances, no turning back,
like Hardcore mode in Diablo, lol.

A software engineer solves ordinary problems.
A hardcore software engineer solves hardcore problems—fundamental challenges that no one has truly cracked, problems so ingrained in daily life that we’ve learned to ignore them.

One of those problems? Food waste.
We unknowingly contribute to 1 billion tons of wasted food per year, while hunger still persists.
And yet, we constantly struggle with a simple question: "What to eat tonight?"

So, I figured—why not start solving it?

If we ever reach Mars, will food waste still be a problem there? Probably.

I took this project as a personal challenge — to push my limits as a software engineer within just two weeks,
standing on the shoulders of giants (Hi, AIs), and leveraging all the tech skills I’ve learned.

To imagine:

What if we could use RoboTaxis freely (or other automated sustainable transportation)?
How could a simple system idea help reduce food waste in this imaginary world?
I wanted to start with a simple question:
What to eat tonight?

### Postscript - 16th Feb 2025

This project gave my brain the highest stimulation I’ve ever enjoyed.
I really wish I could continue working on it, but I think my playtime is over for now.
I need to return to daily life, trying to use my skills to break free from the life jail.

This project felt like a 10-minute, 1-minute, and 10-second art drawing speed challenge.
In reality, time is always the true enemy.

The hardest part was deciding what to sacrifice within this short timeframe to achieve a result.
So many decisions had to be made.
So many branches of ideas had to be cut.
So much struggle over the "how."

If I wanted to simulate realistic household behavior or provide accurate recipe suggestions, it would be an endless rabbit hole.
In the end, I kept them as dummy data—because sometimes, done is better than perfect.

I chatted with AI every day. It was game-changing.
Without this giant, I couldn't have achieved what I did in just two weeks.

It felt like assembling a Lego structure—finding the right piece and snapping it in place, without worrying whether that piece even existed.

There will always be someone who can do it better in 1 minute, or maybe even finish it in 10 seconds (maybe future General AI).
But to me, the spirit lies in never stopping the pursuit of learning and self-challenge.

And this is what makes humans different from AI:
Humans are, ultimately, responsible for our own existence.
We bear the consequences of our decisions and take responsibility for our lives—something AI cannot replace.

AI could technically make decisions that affect human lives, but responsibility? That is ours.

Think about the first human who invented a bow—solving starvation with a simple tool.
The bow and arrow didn’t come from the void.
They came from human ingenuity, from the desire to solve problems.

I want to be that kind of human.
I want to be with the group of this kind of human.

I hope this project becomes an arrow that helps me solve my daily problems.
